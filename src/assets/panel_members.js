    "Craig Watters joins the School of Entrepreneurship as the Norman C. Stevenson Chair in School of Entrepreneurship in Entrepreneurship, beginning Fall 2011. Craig is an accomplished scholar, educator, entrepreneur, manager, and economic developer. He comes to OSU from the top-ranked entrepreneurship program at Syracuse University, where he has led of portfolio of educational and community engagement initiatives. He has worked with faculty across an array of disciplines on curriculum development and outreach programs related to creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship. Craig helped conceptualize and launch the highly successful South Side Entrepreneurial Connect Project, which has contributed to the transformation of an economically-challenged inner city community. He has served as assistant dean for advancement in the School of Information Studies at Syracuse, and director of its economic stimulus center, the I-Launch Pad. His research and community work led to his nomination for an economic development award from Senator Hillary Clinton in 2003 and travel to Ireland as part of Clinton’s trade mission in 2002."

    "Shlomo Nir is Professor Emeritus at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HUJI). 1969 Ph.D-Theoretical Physics. Thesis: Atomic Spectroscopy; calculations of energy levels. 1970 Fellow, Inst. Life Sciences, HUJI.  1970-1980. RPMI, Buffalo NY. Cancer Research Scientist I-IV, and Assoc. Prof.  Biophysics; University of NY, Buffalo. 1980 Assoc. Prof. HUJI; Dept Soil and water Sciences.1985 Professor. 2003 Professor Emeritus. Recent research mainly on Water Purification. Developed models for: 1. Simultaneous adsorption of several cations(including organic caions) to surfaces, electrostatic equations and specific binding in a closed system: applied to biological membranes and clays, and extended to organic cations. 2. Particle aggregation, extent and kinetics. 3. Membrane fusion and endocytosis 4. Pore formation by peptides. 5. Kinetics of filtration for a solution with several pollutants. The model has yielded simulations and predictions for removal of chemicals and bacteria for laboratory and pilot scales. 6. Degradaion during filtration. The model, which predicts steady state phenomena was applied in (i) removal from fish ponds of off flavor compounds (ii)Very efficient purification of lake drinking water. Designed organo-clay complexes, which remove from water efficiently chemicals and microorganisms. Published 265 articles in Journals and books, 4 books, 6 patents; h-index 96."
